## Reflection
This approach transforms the platform from a self-service tool to a premium design service, creating a higher value proposition while reducing technical complexity. The challenge is maintaining quality control and delivery timelines while scaling the designer team.

The key assumption is that customers prefer professional results over instant gratification and are willing to pay for quality and wait for delivery. Success depends on consistent delivery quality and meeting promised timelines.
