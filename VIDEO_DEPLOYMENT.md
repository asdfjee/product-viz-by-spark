# Video Deployment Guide

## Issue: Videos Not Showing After Deployment

If videos are not showing up when you publish your site, follow these steps:

### Solution Implemented:

1. **Moved videos to public directory**: Videos are now served from `/public/videos/` instead of being imported as modules
2. **Updated video paths**: Changed from import statements to public URLs (e.g., `/videos/filename.mp4`)
3. **Added error handling**: Enhanced video components now gracefully handle loading failures
4. **Added server configuration**: `.htaccess` file for proper MIME types and CORS headers

### Files Changed:
- `src/App.tsx`: Updated video imports and added EnhancedVideo component
- `public/videos/`: Added video files for production serving
- `public/.htaccess`: Added server configuration for video files

### Deployment Checklist:
1. ✅ Videos moved to `public/videos/` directory
2. ✅ Video paths updated to use public URLs
3. ✅ Error handling and loading states added
4. ✅ Server configuration for proper video serving
5. ✅ CORS headers configured
6. ✅ Proper MIME types set

### If videos still don't work:
1. Check browser console for video loading errors
2. Verify video files are accessible at `/videos/filename.mp4`
3. Ensure your hosting provider supports video file serving
4. Check file size limits (consider compressing large videos)
5. Try converting videos to web-optimized formats if needed

### Video Formats Supported:
- MP4 (recommended)
- WebM
- OGG
- MOV (converted to MP4)

The enhanced video component will automatically show a fallback placeholder if videos fail to load.
