# Video Deployment Guide

## Issue: Videos Not Showing on Published Website

The videos are stored in `/public/videos/` but may not be accessible in production. Here's how to fix it:

## Current Video Files Required

Make sure these files exist in your `public/videos/` directory:

1. `modern-living-room-transformation.mp4`
2. `Cozy_Room_Transformation_Video_(1).mp4` 
3. `Kitchen_Pan_Video_Generation.mp4`

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Verify Files Exist
Ensure all video files are in the `public/videos/` directory of your project.

### 2. Check File Sizes
Large video files (>25MB) may not deploy properly on some platforms. Consider compressing videos if needed.

### 3. Platform-Specific Instructions

#### GitHub Pages
- Ensure the `public/videos/` folder is committed to your repository
- Videos should be accessible at `https://yourusername.github.io/yourrepo/videos/filename.mp4`

#### Netlify
- The `public` folder contents are automatically served
- Check the deploy logs for any file upload errors
- Verify videos are accessible at `https://yoursite.netlify.app/videos/filename.mp4`

#### Vercel
- Static files in `public` are served automatically
- Check deployment logs for any size limit warnings
- Test video URLs: `https://yoursite.vercel.app/videos/filename.mp4`

### 4. Troubleshooting

If videos still don't work:

1. **Check browser console** for video loading errors
2. **Test video URLs directly** by visiting them in browser
3. **Check file permissions** (should be readable)
4. **Verify MIME types** are properly configured for .mp4 files

### 5. Alternative: Use Video CDN

For better performance, consider uploading videos to:
- YouTube (embed)
- Vimeo (embed) 
- AWS S3 + CloudFront
- Google Cloud Storage

## File Verification

The app includes automatic video checking in development mode. Check browser console for video availability status.

## Production Testing

After deployment:
1. Visit your site
2. Navigate to the homepage
3. Check if video previews load
4. Open browser dev tools and check for any video loading errors

## Common Issues

- **404 errors**: Videos not deployed or wrong paths
- **CORS errors**: Server not configured to serve video files
- **Size limits**: Videos too large for hosting platform
- **Format issues**: Browser compatibility with video format

## Current Video Paths

The app expects these exact paths:
- `/videos/modern-living-room-transformation.mp4`
- `/videos/Cozy_Room_Transformation_Video_(1).mp4`
- `/videos/Kitchen_Pan_Video_Generation.mp4`

Make sure filenames match exactly (including capitalization and special characters).
